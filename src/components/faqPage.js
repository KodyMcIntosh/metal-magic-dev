    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div className="halves">
      <div className="leftHalf faqBlock"><h3>How old do I have to be?</h3>
        <p>You need to be 16 to legally get a piercing without parental consent. There are some piercings that I restrict to customers who are 18 and over - any intimate piercings, or piercings that carry a higher long-term risk of scarring and damage. If you are under 16 you can get a piercing with parental consent. I require identification from both parent and piercee, and you will receive all the information on ID requirements / proof of guardianship when you make your booking. Your parent must be present to sign the consent form for you, and must remain in the studio for the procedure.</p>

        <h3>Do you pierce children's ears?</h3>
        <p>Yes, I pierce earlobes from ages 5 and up. This doesn't necessarily mean that your child is ready for a piercing at 5 though! I always leave time to have a quick chat to the parent and the child, and in some cases I will recommend waiting until your child is a bit older. It is also really common with my younger piercees to get one earlobe pierced and then not want to continue with the second side. This is fine! I will never push any piercee to follow through with a piercing they are not comfortable with. Most of the time, I see these young ones back in a few weeks to finish off the other side. ID requirements, as stated above, will apply for young children getting their earlobes pierced as well.</p>

        <h3>What do I need to do before a piercing?</h3>
        <p>Get a good night's sleep the night beforehand. Have something decent to eat within 4 hours of your appointment. Avoid drinking heavily the night beforehand. Make sure you're wearing clothes and hairstyles that will allow easy access to the piercing site.</p>

        <h3>What is your policy around mask wearing?</h3>
        <p>Currently, you do not need to wear masks in the piercing studio. You are most welcome to wear one if you prefer. For my clients who are still wearing masks frequently, I also will put one on while I come and consult with you around piercing placement, jewellery etc. </p>

        <h3>What do I need to bring to my appointment?</h3>
        <p>You must bring photo ID, regardless of age. No ID means no piercing, and may result in the forfeiture of your deposit. Please bring any reference pictures if we are doing a consultation for curated piercing sets. If you are getting an ear / nostril / bridge piercing and are a glasses wearer, please be sure to bring your glasses with you. Please be aware that due to Health and Safety requirements, proper footwear must be worn by everyone in the studio. Bare feet are not acceptable. If you do not have proper footwear to put on, we will need to reschedule your appointment and you will lose your deposit. </p>

        <h3>How long does a piercing take?</h3>
        <p>Most single piercing appointments are 30 minutes long. This gives us 10 minutes to have a chat and decide on jewellery, 10 minutes for me to sterilise your piercing setup, and 10 minutes to complete your piercing. Please allow some extra time for your appointment, as occasionally I can be running behind schedule. If you feel you need more time to be selecting your jewellery you are welcome to come in before your appointment to browse the different options we have in stock. If you are feeling extra nervous about your piercing, please let us know when you book in so I can allocate some extra time to you. </p>

        <h3>How do I get there?</h3>
        <p><strong>By car:</strong> Metal Magic is easily accessible by car, and is close to the Nelson Street motorway offramp. There is paid on-street parking further down Union Street, a paid Wilson's car park at the top of Nelson Street, or you can also use the Parkable app to find off-street parking along Union Street.<br />
        <strong>By public transport:</strong> the closest bus stop is the Nicholas Street bus stop, off Hobson Street. This is around a 5 minute walk from the studio.</p>

        <h3>Can I bring my friends?</h3>
        <p>You are most welcome to bring your friends along! However, as we are a small space, we can only accomodate 1 support person in the piercing procedure room. For parents bringing their child in for piercings, please note that we cannot accomodate extra siblings in the piercing room. Children 12 and over may wait quietly unattended in the waiting area, but children younger than this who are not being pierced must be left with a caregiver. For parents getting piercings, if your child is old enough to sit and wait quietly in the piercing room while you are having your procedure you are welcome to bring them along. If your child is disruptive or cannot follow directions, I will decline to perform your piercing, and you will forfeit your deposit.</p>

        <h3>Do you do tattoos?</h3>
        <p>No, we don't do any tattoos. I am very happy to recommend some awesome local artists that I have worked alongside before though!</p>

        <h3>I'm really scared about how much a piercing will hurt. Can I use numbing cream?</h3>
        <p>It's normal to feel nervous about getting a new piercing. Piercings can be uncomfortable, but the vast majority of piercings aren't nearly as bad as people expect them to be, and are finished in just a few seconds. I will not pierce people that have applied numbing creams. Numbing cream can distort the tissue, which means that as it wears off, your beautifully placed piercing can become crooked. It also doesn't numb the deeper sensation of a piercing. If you have applied numbing cream, I will be unable to pierce you and you may forfeit your deposit for your appointment. If you are feeling anxious about your piercing, please let me know when you book in and I can allocate extra time to walk you through the procedure and make sure you are feeling 100% comfortable and confident.</p>

        <h3>Do you use piercing guns?</h3>
        <p>No, we do not use piercing guns for any piercings. The risk of cross-contamination with these instruments is high, the operators usually do not have the same high level of training as a professional piercer, and the method of piercing relies on brute force to push a dull stud through the tissue, causing excessive trauma to the tissue. For more information on piercing guns, please <Link to="https://safepiercing.org/piercing-guns/" target="_blank">read this article.</Link></p>

        <h3>Do I need to make a booking?</h3>
        <p>Bookings are not mandatory, but are strongly recommended. I tend to book out around a week in advance, and weekends may be booked out even further in advance. If you are wanting a walk-in appointment, you are welcome to call us to see what availability I have that day.</p>

        <h3>Do you sell jewellery over the counter?</h3>
        <p>I require appointments for all jewellery sales. Body jewellery is not one-size-fits-all, and I need to make sure that whichever piece you're picking out is going to sit well in your piercing without causing any issues. Your appointment includes sterilisation and installation of your new piece of jewellery. </p>

        <h3>How do I know that I am getting a safe piercing from you?</h3>
        <p>I take health and safety incredibly seriously. Metal Magic Piercings is a disposable studio, so any tools and needles used on you are immediately throws out or placed in a sharps container. I use a benchtop Statim autoclave to sterilise your piercing set up immediately before your procedure takes place. All autoclave cycles are run with an integrator tag which confirms that parameters for sterilisation have been met, which is stapled into a folder along with your details. My autoclave is helix tested to confirm it is working correctly at the beginning of each day, and is serviced at 6 monthly intervals. You are welcome to view our records at any time. I exclusively use internally threaded or pushfit / threadless implant grade jewellery from reputable manufacturers for your piercings. I am most happy to provide mill certificates for your jewellery if requested.
